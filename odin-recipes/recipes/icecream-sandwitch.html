        <li>Once the milk is hot but not boiling, begin whisking small ladlefuls of the hot milk into the yolk mixture until the mixture is hot. </li>
        <li>Once the mixture is hot add back to the pot of milk. Heating and stirring over medium heat until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Make sure not to simmer or boil. </li>
        <li>Strain the mixture into a bowl set in an ice bath to cool it down. </li>
        <li>Add in heavy whipping cream and combine. </li>
        <li>Add custard base to an ice cream maker and churn to the manufacturer's directions. </li>

    <h3>Giant Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich</h3>

        <li>In a bowl or stand mixer, combine packed light brown sugar, granulated white sugar, and whisk together using the whisk attachment until combined. </li>
        <li>Stream in the melted butter, fine sea salt, and once combined add in a large egg followed by one egg yolk. Whisk vigorously until emulsified. </li>
        <li>Switch to the paddle attachment and while whisking add in all-purpose flour and mix until combined. </li>
        <li>Using a spatula, fold in the roughly chopped dark chocolate until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. </li>
        <li>Using an ice cream scoop, scoop out as many cookie balls as possible and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Bake in a 350F oven for 15-17 minutes. Intentionally picking the pan up and dropping it every 4-5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Once done, remove the cookies out to cool and top with flaky salt. </li>
